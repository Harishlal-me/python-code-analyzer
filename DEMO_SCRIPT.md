# My 2-Minute Demo Script 🎤

## Introduction (15 seconds)
"Hi, I'm Harishlal. My tool analyzes Python files using AST parsing to extract and display all functions, classes, and imports along with their line numbers. It also generates JSON and text summary reports for quick understanding of code structure. I used Claude AI as an assistant for guidance and improvement during development."

## The Problem (20 seconds)
"When working with large codebases, it's time-consuming to manually understand what's in a file - what functions exist, what classes are defined, what dependencies it has. My tool automatically extracts and organizes all this information in seconds."
