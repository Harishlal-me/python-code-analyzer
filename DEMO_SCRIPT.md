# My 2-Minute Demo Script 🎤

## Introduction (15 seconds)
"Hi, I'm Harishlal. My tool analyzes Python files using AST parsing to extract and display all functions, classes, and imports along with their line numbers. It also generates JSON and text summary reports for quick understanding of code structure. I used Claude AI as an assistant for guidance and improvement during development."

---

## The Problem (20 seconds)
"When working with large codebases, it's time-consuming to manually understand what's in a file - what functions exist, what classes are defined, what dependencies it has. My tool automatically extracts and organizes all this information in seconds."

## Live Demo (60 seconds)

### 1. Show the Input File (10 sec)
**Say:** "Here's a Python file with multiple classes, functions, and imports."

**Do:** Point to `largecode.py` on the left side of screen

---

### 2. Run the Analyzer (15 sec)
**Say:** "Let me analyze this file..."

**Type in terminal:**
python analyzer.py examples/largecode.py

## 3.Save the json file and summary txt file 
** file gets saved **

Introduction (15s)
“Hi, I’m Harishlal. I built a Python code analyzer that uses AST parsing to extract all functions, classes and imports with line numbers. It also generates JSON and text summary reports, so you can quickly understand file structure. I used Claude AI as an assistant for guidance during development.”

Problem (20s)
“When working with large codebases, it's hard and time-consuming to manually understand what’s inside a file—functions, classes, and dependencies. My tool solves this by extracting and organizing everything automatically in seconds.”

Live Demo (60s)

“Here’s a Python file with multiple classes, functions and imports.” (show largecode.py)

“Now I’ll analyze it.” (run command)

python analyzer.py examples/largecode.py


“As you can see, it prints the extracted structure here, and it also saves two output files: a JSON report and a summary TXT file.” (show saved files/output folder)
