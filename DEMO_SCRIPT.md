# My 2-Minute Demo Script 🎤

## Introduction (15 seconds)
"Hi, I'm [Your Name]. I built a Python code analyzer that helps developers quickly understand code structure - like having X-ray vision for Python files."

---

## The Problem (20 seconds)
"When working with large codebases, it's time-consuming to manually understand what's in a file - what functions exist, what classes are defined, what dependencies it has. My tool automatically extracts and organizes all this information in seconds."
